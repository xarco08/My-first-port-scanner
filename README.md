# My-first-port-scanner
here  I provide my first port scanner in bash using nmap <br> I am planning to make one in python3 next<br>  **USAGE**  to use this script clone this repository with git clone and the URL of this rep,<br>  then cd into the directory and give execution priviledges to the .sh file by using chmod +x customscan.sh ,<br>  lastly to scan an ip -> ./customscan.sh 1.1.1.1 (example, instead of 1.1.1.1 type your target's adress)<br>  this is just a fast basic scanner that shosw the TCP ports open on the target and saves a report in Grep format called "scan"
